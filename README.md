# SecureBlackjack
Final Project for CS492 - Computer Security

For our final project we re-created Blackjack implementing RSA private/public key signing and cryptographic random number generation. The purpose of this project was to implement security principles learned through the course.

This project simulates a network connection by using your computer's filesystem. In order to run this project, you must have a folder under C:\Blackjack\CONTROLLER for communications.

Done as a group of two with partner @Alanator222 (Alan Stano)
Grade Recieved : 98/100
